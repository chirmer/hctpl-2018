        <section class="flex flex-col">

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The Behavior in the Library policy is established to provide 
                guidelines for patron behavior that will ensure the safety 
                of staff and patrons as well as maintaining a welcoming 
                atmosphere in the library and providing equitable access 
                to all individuals.
            </p>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Behavior rules apply to all patrons of Huntington City-Township 
                Public Library when using library facilities, or when 
                participating in library programs. Inappropriate conduct 
                includes any individual or group activity which is unreasonably 
                disturbing to other individuals lawfully using library 
                facilities, materials and/or premises or is otherwise inconsistent 
                with activities such as reading, studying, properly using library 
                materials and other similar conduct normally associated with a 
                public library.
            </p>
            <h2>Definition of inappropriate behaviors</h2>

            <h2>Staff response to infractions</h2>  
                <p>
                    Violation of one or more of the behaviors listed above shall 
                    constitute misconduct that will result in enforcement of 
                    the policy which may include expulsion from the library and 
                    forfeiture of library privileges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Minor violations of these rules will first result in library 
                    staff attempting to educate or warn individuals about policies 
                    and enforcement. Repeat misconduct or severe offenses (even 
                    in a single isolated event) may result in individuals being 
                    banned from the Library for a minimum of one day to a maximum 
                    of one year. Library staff will follow the banning procedure 
                    set forth below.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Huntington City-Township Library has a zero tolerance policy 
                    for threats and acts of violence. Any conduct that threatens 
                    the life or safety of any person or that is damaging to library 
                    property, equipment or facilities will result in immediate 
                    expulsion from the library.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Library staff is authorized to contact law enforcement in 
                    response to any illegal behavior or in the event an individual 
                    refuses to leave the library when expelled. Staff may also 
                    contact law enforcement to assist in the management of any 
                    situation which may be considered dangerous or unpredictable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever possible bans should be issued by a Department Head 
                    or the Library Director; however, all staff are fully empowered 
                    to issue bans at any time without prior approval.
                </p>
                <h2>Banning procedure</h2>
                <p>
                    If a person has engaged in severe or repeat misconduct 
                    and staff has determined that the individual involved 
                    should be banned:
                </p>
                <ul class="fa-ul">
                    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right green"></i></span>
                        Staff will issue a written notice to the individual involved 
                        stating that the individual is banned from the premise of 
                        Huntington City-Township Public Library and the Markle Branch. 
                        Any expulsion from one location is to be considered in force 
                        at all locations. The notice will indicate the reasons for the 
                        ban and the time period of the ban. A copy of the ban notice 
                        will be given to the individual at the time the ban is issued. 
                        If necessary the ban may be mailed to the individual.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right green"></i></span>
                        If the patron is a minor, an attempt will be made to contact 
                        the parent or legal guardian. If no contact is possible, a 
                        copy of the ban notice must be sent to the parent or legal 
                        guardian.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right green"></i></span>
                        A copy of all Ban Notice forms with all documentation will 
                        be given to the Library Director within 24 hours of the banning 
                        action. The Director has the power to affirm, modify, or 
                        revoke any suspension or banning.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                        If any person who has been issued a Ban Notice enters any 
                        Huntington City-Township Public Library location before the 
                        return date listed on the Ban Notice, he or she will be asked 
                        to leave. Refusal to comply with the Ban Notice may result in 
                        contact with law enforcement.
                </p>
                <h2>Appeal procedure</h2>
                <p>
                        Any person who is issued a ban notice may appeal the ban. A 
                        request for appeal must be made in writing to the Library 
                        Director. The Director will review the ban and the appeal 
                        and determine the status of the ban. If the Director upholds 
                        the ban a second appeal may be made to the Library Board. The 
                        request for appeal must be sent in writing to the Library 
                        Board President. The appeal will be heard at a regular Library 
                        Board meeting. The Library Board will vote on the status of 
                        the ban.
